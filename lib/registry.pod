=head1 ABSTRACT

Register Type Libraries with Namespace

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package main;

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use registry;

  $registry;

  # $registry->('main')
  # 'main' Type::Registry object

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This pragma is used to associate namespaces with L<Type::Tiny> type libraries.
A C<$registry> variable is made available to the caller to be used to access
registry objects. The variable is a callback (i.e. coderef) which should be
called with a single argument, the namespace whose registry object you want,
otherwise the argument defaults to C<main>.

  package main;

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use registry 'Types::Standard';
  use registry 'Types::Common::Numeric';
  use registry 'Types::Common::String';

  $registry;

  # my $constraint = $registry->('main')->lookup('StrLength[10]')

You can configure the caller (namespace) to be associated with multiple
distinct type libraries. The exported C<$registry> object can be used to reify
type constraints and resolve type expressions.
