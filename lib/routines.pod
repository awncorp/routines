=head1 ABSTRACT

Typeable Method and Function Signatures

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package main;

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use routines;

  fun hello($name) {
    "hello, $name"
  }

  hello("world");

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This pragma is used to provide typeable method and function signtures to the
calling package, as well as C<before>, C<after>, and C<around> method
modifiers. Additionally, when used in concert with the L<registry> pragma, this
pragma will check to determine whether a L<Type::Tiny> registry object is
associated with the calling package, and if so will use it to reify type
constraints and resolve type expressions.

  package main;

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use registry;
  use routines;

  fun hello(Str $name) {
    "hello, $name"
  }

  hello("world");

Additionally, when used in concert with the L<registry> pragma this pragma will
check to determine whether a L<Type::Tiny> registry object is associated with
the calling package, and if so will use it to reify type constraints and
resolve type expressions.

  package Example;

  use Moo;
  use registry;
  use routines;

  fun new($class) {
    bless {}
  }

  method hello(Str $name) {
    "hello, $name"
  }

  around hello(Str $name) {
    $self->{name} = $name;

    $self->$orig($name);
  }

  1;

As mentioned previously, this pragma makes the C<before>, C<after>, and
C<around> method modifiers available the calling package where those keywords
were already present in their generic subroutine form.
